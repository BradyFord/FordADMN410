<h2>About Eco-Friendly Paper Straws</h2>
<p>
Hi hy name is Brady Ford and I would like you to join me on saving the earth one paper straw at a time. Welcome to Eco-Friendly Straws(EFS), a company dedicated to promoting eco-friendly paper straws! We are a family run business that believes small changes can make a big difference when it comes to protecting our planet. By choosing our paper straws over plastic ones, you can help reduce plastic waste and its harmful impact on the environment. Our straws have been proven to decompose 400 times faster than generic plastic straws. Moreover, our straws are produced with fewer chemicals than other paper straw manufacturers. Help us help the earth!
</p>
<h2>Why Choose Paper Straws?</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Biodegradable and compostable-</li>
<li>Renewable resource-</li>
<li>Chemical-free and safe-</li>
<li>Sturdy and reliable-</li>
<li>Customizable designs</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
The goal at EFS inc. is to ultimatly lower the amount of plastic that intoxicates our plaet and harms our wildlife. Each day millions of animals die from plastic that humans have not disposed of properly. We see the easiest solution to this problem to be promoting the use of biodegradeable straws that take only 6 months to decompose, rather than plastic straws that can take 200 years to fully decompose.
